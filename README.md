Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
Converting Casual Riders into Annual Members Using Data

Role: Junior Data Analyst
Tools: Excel / Google Sheets, SQL, R
Dataset: Public Divvy Bike-Share Data (Cyclistic – fictional company)

🔍 Project Overview

Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago seeking to increase profitability by converting casual riders into annual members. While casual riders generate revenue, internal analysis shows that annual members are significantly more profitable.

In this project, I analyzed historical bike trip data to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, and how those insights can inform targeted marketing strategies.

🎯 Business Question

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Answering this question helps the marketing team design campaigns that encourage casual riders to become long-term members.

🗂️ Data & Tools
Data Source

12 months of historical bike-share trip data

Publicly available and licensed through Motivate International Inc.

Personally identifiable information excluded for privacy compliance

Tools Used

Google Sheets / Excel: Cleaning, calculations, pivot tables, charts

SQL: Data aggregation, filtering, trend analysis

R (RStudio): Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using tidyverse

🧹 Data Preparation & Cleaning

To ensure accuracy and consistency, I:

Removed rides with invalid or negative durations

Created new calculated fields:

Ride Length (time difference between start and end)

Day of Week (based on ride start date)

Standardized column names and formats across all files

Merged multiple monthly datasets into a single dataset for analysis

This process ensured the data was clean, reliable, and ready for analysis.

📊 Analysis & Key Findings
1. Ride Duration

Casual riders take significantly longer rides on average

Annual members take shorter, more frequent rides

📌 Insight: Casual riders are more leisure-oriented, while members prioritize efficiency.

2. Weekly Usage Patterns

Annual members ride most often during weekdays

Casual riders peak on weekends

📌 Insight: Members primarily use bikes for commuting, while casual riders use them recreationally.

3. Ride Frequency

Annual members account for a higher total number of rides

Casual riders ride less frequently but for longer durations

📌 Insight: Membership aligns with habitual, repeat usage.

📈 Visualizations

Average ride length by rider type

Number of rides by day of week and rider type

Weekly usage trend comparisons

Visualizations were created using pivot tables, charts, and ggplot2 to clearly communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders.

💡 Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend:

1. Target Weekend Casual Riders

Focus marketing campaigns on weekend riders, when casual usage is highest, with limited-time membership promotions.

2. Highlight Cost Savings

Demonstrate how frequent casual riders can save money by switching to an annual membership instead of purchasing single or day passes.

3. Leverage Digital Touchpoints

Use email and in-app notifications immediately after rides to encourage casual riders to upgrade while engagement is high.

🧠 Conclusion

This analysis revealed clear behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members. Casual riders primarily use Cyclistic bikes for leisure, while annual members use them as a reliable transportation option. These insights provide a strong foundation for targeted, data-driven marketing strategies aimed at increasing annual memberships.
